How can you detect collection and data exfiltration with wetransfer in your proxy logs ?

### Data Exfiltration Indicators:

- Regular browsing to `wetransfer.com` entails periodic GET requests to `https://backgrounds.wetransfer.net/creator/wepresent-*` approximately every 40 seconds.
- The process of uploading files begins with email confirmation, which involves a POST request to `https://wetransfer.com/api/v4/transfers/email`.
- Further file manipulations will lead to requests to `https://wetransfer.com/api/v4/transfers/*`
- Upon email confirmation, file uploads proceed via a backend API URL `https://e-10220.adzerk.net/api/v2`. However, note that this URL is subject to frequent changes.

### Data Collection Indicators:

- The targeted user will get an email from WeTransfer containing a single download link
- The download link follow the patterns:
  - `https://wetransfer.com/downloads/*`
  - `https://we.tl/t-*`
  - (Each link ends with a unique id)

and for collection, hunt for requests to **`*wetransfer.com/downloads/*`** or **`we.tl/t-*`**
